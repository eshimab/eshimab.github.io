# Terminal

## Use `ls -a` to see hidden folder and files that start with `.` 

```bash
# Short-form
ls -a
# Combine with -l
ls -al
```

Yes, the long form of the -a option in the ls command is --all. Both -a and --all have the same functionality of showing all files, including hidden ones.

Need to add `code`
```bash
nano ~/.bash_profile
```
